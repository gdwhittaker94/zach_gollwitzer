**Practice: Inserting content into left sections**

1. Select empty div container that will house generated meme

    const memeHiddenContainer = document.querySelector('#meme');

2. Check to see if it outputs (i.e. we've selected correct element)

    console.log(memeHiddenContainer) ✅

3. Create new element in the empty div, and as it's an img element we are obligated to add a 'src' attribute and a value

    const newElement = document.createElement('img');
    newElement.setAttribute('src', 'https://i.redd.it/a0v87gwzoge61.jpg')

4. Insert this new element into div container

    memeHiddenContainer.appendChild(newElement) ✅


**LEARNED**

JS
- function showQuote() --> the value is an object with two properties inside it (quote + author). Therefore, have to use the dot syntax in order to access those properties their content (not array selector syntax!).

- Visualise the process as just looking at the lines of code doesn't help me write it or understand it (draw on paper if necessary).

- Writing ".innerHTML = ''" (an empty string value) clears the content of an element.

- for .querySelector() don't forget to add a # or . in order to grab onto HTML elements!
